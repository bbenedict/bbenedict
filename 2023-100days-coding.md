### 100 days of coding

We're coming to the end of 2023 and my brain is telling me I haven't tried
to learn enough this year.  Seems like that's always the case.  I see a New Year's
resolution coming and so I start thinking it over in Nov and workong on it in Dec.

Started from experiment of a unified completion function...


Here's what I am hoping to learn:

* How to start an open source project from scratch 
  * Set up github, org...
  * Manage issues...
  * Docs...
* Best practices for python package creation and updating
  * Tooling
  * PEP XXX ???
* Test strategies when a significant portion of the app uses third party APIs 
  * Mocking data
  * Validating if the service has changed 
* Going live with the first version
  * How to validate it's ready...
  * Now waht...

Disclosure - started several days ago...
