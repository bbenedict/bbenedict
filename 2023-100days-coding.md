### 100 days of coding

We're coming to the end of 2023 and my brain is telling me I haven't tried
to learn enough this year.  Seems like that's always the case.  I start thinking it 
over in Nov and workong on it in Dec in anticipation of the inevitable New Year's 
resolution.

I am kicking off 100 days of coding inspired by a small test project I did a few months ago.
I was exploring all the different ways to use prompts with LLMs and created a unified
completion function that handled system prompts, context and streaing.  Here's the code.
The undescore is the content which can be used when not streaming.

```
_, messages = get_completion(client,
                             content_callback,
                             user_prompt="Who won the first world series?",
                             system_prompt="Explain this like a child is talking to an adult",
                             stream_response=True
                             )

_, messages = get_completion(client, content_callback, user_prompt="Who was the most valuable player?", messages=messages)

_, messages = get_completion(client, content_callback, user_prompt="Who was the most recent MVP of this?", messages=messages)

```

I began thinking how I might use this idea in other ways.  My first python package? My first managed open source
project? The potential for learning continued to grow, which led me to this project.  I am calling it completion
paths.  A completion path allows you to look several completions generated by third party APIs together passing 
the results from one step to the next.  At least, this is the initial idea.

Here's what I am hoping to learn:

* How to start an open source project from scratch?
  * How to set up the org, the repo, the project
  * What does a good project look like?
  * How do you create docs, manage issues, promote your work?
* What are best practices for python package creation and updating?
  * What tools do you use to create a deploy a new package?
  * How does the CI/CD pipeline factor in?
  * What standards like PEP 8 do people follow?
* How do you valiate a package where a significant portion of the app uses third party APIs?
  * How do you create automated tests without driving up significant cost?
  * How do you track if the serice is changed?
* Your live, what's next?
