### 100 days of ~~coding~~ learning something technical

I'm going to do something along the lines of the 100 days of code project. 
But instead of coding a single project, and I going to try out different things
like development enviroments, technologies and training materials.  So maybe I
should call it 100 days of learning something technical.

These are my areas of focus

* ML/AI
  * Coursera ML/AI courses
  * O'Reilly Python Machine Learning books
  * Springer Recommendation systems 
* React/UI/UX
  * Fullstack D3js
  * React 16 exploration of hooks
* Full stack 
  * React/Express/Node/Mongo (otherwise known as the project that will never be done)
  * React/Express/Node/MySQL (otherwise known as my day job)
  * GraphQL serverless 
* And now for something completely different
  * Smalltalk best practices
  * A console in Rust (saw this somewhere)
  * Clojure or Elm or Haskell
  
## day 1

Linked my github repo to codesadnbox.io and started two projects.  Second project was a react app where I installed style-components to observer the package life cycle using codesandbox.io.  I see a ton of uses for codesadnbox.io
